# Do you want a clean install? This is recommended but please note that

# one, otherwise set it to "yes".
#
INSTALLFROMSCRATCH="no"

# Do you plan to use this box otherwise while compiling? If so, you'd
# probably set this variable to "yes". If this is set to "no", the
# compilation process will try to eat up all the ressources, which speeds up
# the overall progress but makes it a PITA to work on this box. ;)

# Do you want any special branch? If so, specify its tag here e.g.

# If you would like a virgin cvs copy set this field to "yes", otherwise set

# is executed for every module).
# Developers might find this pretty dangerous considering that they could have
# forgotten to 'cvs add' a file... ;-)
# Users who want to stay at the bleeding edge will want to activate this in

# Rely on the dependencies for Makefiles and configure?
# If you dare to trust the build system, set it to "yes" ;-)
#
INCREMENTAL_BUILD="no"

# Flags to be passed to the 'configure' script.
# A note: --enable-debug adds minimum debug symbols while an appended
# =full gives you the full power and fills up your beloved hdd much better
# --disable-closure is actually prefered if it works for you. It will
# not create closure targets but link with some compiler flags to make
# sure the compiler will fail when undefined symbols are there - which
# is much faster if it works for you.
#
# You can define module-specific configure flags using
# CONFIGUREFLAGS_ARTS, CONFIGUREFLAGS_KDELIBS, etc. 
# NOTE: These used to be appended to the general $CONFIGUREFLAGS value.
# This is no longer true, you need to use $CONFIGUREFLAGS in the _MODNAME
# version

# If you would like to pass any parameters to make add them here. If you
# do not want to add any parameters leave this empty.
# example:
# MAKE_OPTS="-j 4 -l 4"
#
MAKE_OPTS=""

# If you use unsermake, you can define different flags for the actual
# compilation process. This is useful if you distribute the compilation
# process over several computers, but need to link on one. So you would
# define -j3 here and nothing above.
# You can also use the special "DISTCC" keyword here; if found, it will
# be replaced by the number of hosts listed in the $DISTCC_HOSTS
# environment variable, multiplied by two. Hence, 'DISTCC_HOSTS="a b c"' and
# 'MAKE_OPTS_COMPILE="-jDISTCC"' will result in 'MAKE_OPTS_COMPILE="-j6"'.
# If you set something here, the value will be used alone, otherwise
# MAKE_OPTS will be used alone.
# You can use the special "TEAMBUILDER" keyword too, it will put the
# returned value of tbcompiler -joblimit in there.
#
#MAKE_OPTS_COMPILE=""

# If you would like to compile with a different make, please set it
# here.
