# Where is your Qt 2.2.x?

# If you would like logfiles of the compilation process, specify a directory

KDELOGDIR="$KDESRCDIR/log"

# It has been a good idea to remove the configuration directories of the
# previous KDE desktop by deleting ~.kde back when KDE was Alpha. Now that
# it's Beta quality and starts to become more stable this shouldn't be
# necessary anymore but if you feel like doing so, add the home directories
# of the users whose KDE configuration should be resetted to this space
# seperated list.
# NOTE: This removes the whole configuration, e.g. KMail's filters, Kicker's
# settings, your addressbook etc.!
#
HOMEDIR=""

# Do you want the logfiles to be compressed? Set this variable to "yes" to
# make the script compress the logfiles using bzip2 (using gzip as a
# fallback is bzip2 cannot be found) and thereby save some diskspace.
#
COMPRESSLOGS="yes"

# Add modules you want to get compiled to this space-seperated list. Please
# note that the modules kde-qt-addon, kdesuppor, kdelibs, and kdebase
# (if you want a KDE2 desktop and not just develope applications for it)
# must be compiled in exactly that order. Any other modules are optional.
#
KDEMODULES="kdegraphics kdenetwork kdemultimedia kdegames"

# Do you want a clean install? This is recommended but please note that
# you cannot use your previous KDE2 desktop while the compilation is
# running. Set this to "no" to install the new snapshot over the previous
# one, otherwise set it to "yes".
#
INSTALLFROMSCRATCH="no"

# Do you plan to use this box otherwise while compiling? If so, you'd
# probably set this variable to "yes". If this is set to "no", the
# compilation process will try to eat up all the ressources, which speeds up
# the overall progress but makes it a PITA to work on this box. ;)
#
COMPILENICE="yes"

# Set this variable to "yes" to activate certain cheap tweaks to speed up the
# compilation process. Those tweaks mainly consist of lowering the
# optimization of the resulting binary code.
#
TWEAKCOMPILE="no"

# Which command is used to update your sources?
# anoncvs and cvs users: set this to "cvs"
# cvsup users: set this to "cvsup"
#
CVSCLIENT="cvs"

# For CVS users only: Do you have a CVS account? If so, set this variable to
# the correct name, otherwise leave this blank to use anonymous CVS.

ACCOUNT="raabe"

# Do you want any special branch? If so, specify it's tag here e.g.
# KDE_1_91 for the KDE 1.91 Beta ("Kleopatra") or KDE_1_92 for the
# KDE 1.92 Beta ("Korner"), if you want the plain HEAD branch, leave
# this empty.

# For cvsup users only: specify your preferred cvsup mirror here, check

CVSUPSERVER="cvsup.kde.org"

# If there are any modules in $KDESRCDIR which you don't want to be updated,

# If you would like a virgin cvs copy set this field to "yes", otherwise set
# this to "no" (if set to "yes", 'make -f admin/Makefile.common cvs-clean'
# is executed for every module).
# Developers might find this pretty dangerous considering that they could have
# forgotten to 'cvs add' a file... ;-)
# Users who want to stay at the bleeding edge will want to activate this in
# order to make sure there aren't any remains of a previous compile.
