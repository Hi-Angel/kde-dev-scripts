<chapter id="getting-started">
<title>Getting Started</title>

<para>
In this chapter, we show how to use the &kdesvn-build; to checkout modules from
the &kde; repository and build them. We also provide a basic explanation of the
&kde; &subversion; structure and the steps you have to perform before running
the script.
</para>

<para>
All topics present in this chapter are covered with even more detail in the
<ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/KDE4">
Building &kde; 4 from Source</ulink> article, at the
<ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/">&kde; TechBase site</ulink>.
If you are compiling &kde; for the first time, it is a good idea to read
it, or consult it as a reference source. You will find detailed information
about packaging tools and requirements, common compilation pitfalls and
strategies and information about running your new &kde; installation.
</para>

<sect1 id="before-building">
<title>Preparing the System to Build &kde;</title>

<sect2 id="before-building-users">
<title>Setup a new user account</title>

<para>
It is recommended that you use a different user account to build, install,
and run your &kde; software from, since less permissions are required, and
to avoid interfering with your distribution's packages.
If you already have &kde; packages installed, the best choice
would be to create a different (dedicated) user to build and run the new &kde;.
</para>

<tip><para>Leaving your system &kde; untouched also allows you to have an
emergency fallback in case a compiled &kde; is unstable for whatever reason.
</para></tip>

<para>
Later, you can do a system installation if you wish. This document
does not cover a system installation. If you are performing a system
wide install, you should already know what you are doing. If not, then you
may want to consult the documentation, or help sites, for your distribution
in order to prepare and use the system installation correctly.
</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="before-building-preparation">
<title>Ensure your system is ready to build &kde; source</title>

<para>Before using the &kdesvn-build; script (or any other building
strategy) you must install the development tools and libraries needed for &kde;.
The complete list of required tools can be found from
the <ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/">KDE TechBase</ulink>.
</para>

<para>Here is a list of some of the things you will need:</para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>You will need &cmake;.  The required version will vary
depending on what version of &kde; 4 you are building, see TechBase for
specifics.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Also needed is the &subversion; client program, including
support for Secure HTTP (https). To ensure needed support, you can run
<userinput><command>svn <option>--version</option></command></userinput>.  If
the output says that it handles the https scheme (for write access to
svn.kde.org) or svn scheme (for readonly access to anonsvn.kde.org) then you
should be set to go.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you are building &Qt; or any of the various &kde; modules
that are available from <ulink url="http://gitorious.org/">Gitorious</ulink>
then you will need the <ulink url="http://gitscm.org/">Git source control
manager</ulink> installed as well.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You will need a C++ development environment. GCC 3.4 or
later is recommended.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<note><para>Most operating system distributions include a method of easily
installing required development tools. Consult the TechBase <ulink
url="http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/KDE4">Getting Started</ulink>
page's <quote>Required Packages from your Distribution</quote> section to see
if these instructions are already available.</para></note>

<para>One exception to the required libraries is the &Qt; library.
&kdesvn-build; will normally install a copy of &Qt; whether you have it
installed or not, so it is not necessary for you to have it. If you do not want
to use the &Qt; copy, you need to do these things:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
  <para>Make sure to remove the qt-copy module from your <link
  linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>, as you will not need it,
  and having it would add extra time to your build.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
  <para>Change the setting of the <link linkend="conf-qtdir">qtdir</link>
  option in your <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link> to
  point to your system &Qt;. This is normally equal to the setting of
  $<envar>QTDIR</envar> for your system.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
  <para>If you do not already have &Qt; installed, install it, including any
  relevant -dev or -devel packages. You will need at least
  &Qt; 4.6 if you are building &kde; 4.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Some of these packages are divided into libraries (or programs or utilities), and
development packages. You will need at least the program or library and
its development package. If in doubt, install all. The libraries you need
will change depending on the modules you intend to build, as each module
has its own requirements. The
<ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/KDE4#Required_packages_from_your_distribution">&kde;
TechBase</ulink> has more details
about the specific tools and techniques used to install and find the
required software.
</para>

<sect2 id="before-building-prepare-script">
<title>Setup &kdesvn-build;</title>

<sect3 id="get-kdesvn-build">
<title>Install &kdesvn-build;</title>
<para>
You probably already have a version of the &kdesvn-build; script installed
in your system. However, if you do not, you can download it from
<ulink url="http://kdesvn-build.kde.org/">&kdesvn-build; home page</ulink>,
or you can find it from its home in the &kde; source repository.</para>

<note><para>&kdesvn-build; is included with the kdesdk module, and the module
is often installed by distributions already. If you have downloaded
&kdesvn-build; ensure that you are using the version you downloaded. You can
use the --version option to be sure you are running the version you think
you are.</para></note>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>To download &kdesvn-build; from its home page, simply go to the
<ulink url="http://kdesvn-build.kde.org/">&kdesvn-build; home page</ulink> and download the latest appropriate release. The release is
packaged as a compressed tarball archive, which you can extract using &ark; or
<command>tar</command>. The contents of the archive include the actual
&kdesvn-build; script, and a sample configuration file
(<filename>kdesvn-buildrc-sample</filename>).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Or, you can obtain &kdesvn-build; from its source repository,
located at: <ulink url="http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdesdk/scripts/">http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdesdk/scripts/</ulink>.
This is the &kde; Software Development Kit scripting directory, which is the
home of &kdesvn-build;. You can click on the <filename>kdesvn-build</filename> entry which will
bring you to a page where you can download the latest revision. Do so, and
save it to a convenient spot on your hard disk. Do the same for <filename>kdesvn-buildrc-sample</filename>
if you need to.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>No matter which technique you use, you need to make sure that the
<filename>kdesvn-build</filename> file is executable. For convenience you
should make sure it is in a directory contained in the <envar>PATH</envar>
environment variable, otherwise you may get messages saying that the command
was not found, or you may run a previously-installed version by mistake.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="setup-rcfile">
<title>Prepare the configuration file</title>

<para>Although &kdesvn-build; does not require you to create a <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>, it
makes the work flow much easier. Using a <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>, you can control which
modules are installed, or remove modules you do not want to install. &kdesvn-build;
by default installs a useful &kde; installation using very generic installation
flags, which may be different from your needs. So it is best to use a
<link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>. </para>

<para>The <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link> should be called <filename>.kdesvn-buildrc</filename>.
This file should be installed on
the home folder (<filename class="directory">~/</filename>), and contain all configuration data
required for the script to run, like configuration options,
compiling options, location of the sources, the destination of the installation
(prefix), the modules that should be built, &etc;. The default configuration
data is provided by the <filename>kdesvn-buildrc-sample</filename> file, which
you can copy over as <filename>~/.kdesvn-buildrc</filename> and then edit.
</para>

<para>You can find more information about the syntax of the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>
in <xref linkend="configure-data" /> and in <xref linkend="kdesvn-buildrc" />.
</para>

</sect3>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="configure-data">
<title>Setting the Configuration Data</title>

<para>
To use &kdesvn-build;, you should have a file in your home directory called
<filename>.kdesvn-buildrc</filename>, which sets the general options and sets the modules
you would like to download and build.
</para>

<note><para>It is possible to use different configuration files for &kdesvn-build;,
which is described in <xref linkend="kdesvn-buildrc" />. If you need to use
multiple configurations, please see that section. Here, we will assume the
configuration is stored in <filename>~/.kdesvn-buildrc</filename>.</para></note>

<para>
The easiest way to proceed is to use the
<filename>kdesvn-buildrc-sample</filename> file as a template, changing global
options to match your wants, and also change the list of modules you want to
build.
</para>

<para>
The default settings should actually already be appropriate to perform a
&kde; build. Some settings that you may wish to alter include:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-binpath">binpath</link>, to change the list of
directories that will be searched for commands. This is exactly the same as
the <envar>PATH</envar> variable in the shell.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-kdedir">kdedir</link>, which changes the
destination directory that &kde; is installed to. This defaults to
<filename class="directory">~/kde</filename>, which is a single-user installation.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-qtdir">qtdir</link>, which controls the
path to the installation of &Qt; to use. The defaults to using the qt-copy
module from the &kde; &subversion; repository
(<filename class="directory">~/kdesvn/build/qt-copy</filename>).</para>

<para>For Qt versions that support installation, this also controls where to
install qt-copy.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-svn-server">svn-server</link>, which
selects what &url; to download the sources from. This is useful if you are a
developer with a <ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/Contribute/First_Steps_with_your_KDE_SVN_Account">&kde;
&subversion; account</ulink>.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
After the global section is a list of modules to build, bracketed by
module ... end module lines. Check if the listed modules are in fact the
modules you want to build. The default options from the
<filename>kdesvn-buildrc-sample</filename> file should be enough to get a
fairly complete &kde; installation. Save the result as
<filename>.kdesvn-buildrc</filename> in your home folder.
</para>

<para>
If you wish to fine tune your <filename>.kdesvn-buildrc</filename>,
consult <xref linkend="kdesvn-buildrc" /> for detailed information
about all configuration options.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="building-and-troubleshooting">
<title>Using the &kdesvn-build; script</title>

<para>
Now you are ready to run the script. From a terminal window,
log in to the user you are using to compile &kde; and execute
the script:
<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt><command>kdesvn-build</command>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Now, the script should start downloading the sources and compiling them. Depending on
how many modules you are downloading, it is possible that &kdesvn-build;
will not succeed the first time you compile &kde;. Do not despair!
</para>

<para>&kdesvn-build; logs the output of every command it runs. By default,
the log files are kept in <filename class="directory">~/kdesvn/log</filename>. To see what
the caused an error for a module in the last &kdesvn-build; command, usually
it is sufficient to look at <filename class="directory">~/kdesvn/log/latest/<replaceable>module-name</replaceable>/error.log</filename>.</para>

<para>In that file, you will see the error that caused the build to fail for
that module. If the file says (at the bottom) that you are missing some
packages, try installing the package (including any appropriate -dev packages)
before trying to build that module, and pass the <link
linkend="cmdline-reconfigure">--reconfigure</link> option after installing the
missing packages.</para>

<para>Or, if the error appears to be a build error then it is probably an error
with the &kde; source, which will hopefully be resolved within a few days. If
it is not resolved within that time, feel free to mail the
<email>kde-devel@kde.org</email> mailing list (subscription may be required
first) in order to report the build failure.</para>

<para>You can find more common examples of things that can go wrong and their
solutions, as well as general tips and strategies to build &kde; in the

<sect1 id="environment">
<title>Setting the Environment to Run Your Fresh &kde;</title>

<para>
Assuming you are using a dedicated user to build &kde;, and you already have
an installed &kde; version, running your new &kde; may be a bit tricky, as the new &kde;
has to take precedence over the old. Change the environment variables to
make sure it does.
</para>

<sect2 id="changing-profile">
<title>Changing your startup profile settings</title>

<important><para>The <filename>.bash_profile</filename> is the login settings
file for the popular <application>bash</application> shell used by many &Linux;
distributions. If you use a different shell, then you may need to adjust the
samples given in this section for your particular shell.</para></important>

<para>
Open or create the <filename>.bash_profile</filename> file in the home directory with your favorite editor,
and add to the end of the file:

If you are building the qt-copy module (you are by default), add instead:

<programlisting>
QTDIR=(path to qtdir)   # Such as ~/kdesvn/build/qt-copy by default.
KDEDIR=(path to kdedir) # Such as ~/kde by default.
KDEDIRS=$KDEDIR
PATH=$KDEDIR/bin:$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
MANPATH=$QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH

# Act appropriately if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not already set.
if [ -z $LD_LIBRARY_PATH ]; then
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$KDEDIR/lib:$QTDIR/lib
else
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$KDEDIR/lib:$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
fi

export QTDIR KDEDIRS PATH MANPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</programlisting>

or, if you are not building qt-copy (and are using your system &Qt; instead), add
this instead:

<programlisting>
KDEDIR=(path to kdedir)  # Such as ~/kde by default.
KDEDIRS=$KDEDIR
PATH=$KDEDIR/bin:$QTDIR/bin:$PATH

# Act appropriately if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not already set.
if [ -z $LD_LIBRARY_PATH ]; then
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$KDEDIR/lib
else
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$KDEDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
fi

export KDEDIRS PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
If you are not using a dedicated user, set a different $<envar>KDEHOME</envar>
for your new environment in your <filename>.bash_profile</filename>:

<programlisting>
export KDEHOME="${HOME}/.kde-svn"

# Create it if needed
[ ! -e ~/.kde-svn ] &amp;&amp; mkdir ~/.kde-svn
</programlisting>
</para>

<note>
<para>
If later your K Menu is empty or too crowded with applications from your
distribution, you may have to set the <acronym>XDG</acronym> environment
variables in your <filename>.bash_profile</filename>:

<programlisting>
XDG_CONFIG_DIRS="/etc/xdg"
XDG_DATA_DIRS="${KDEDIR}/share:/usr/share"
export XDG_CONFIG_DIRS XDG_DATA_DIRS
</programlisting>

</para>
</note>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="starting-kde">
<title>Starting &kde;</title>

<para>
Now that you have adjusted your environment settings to use the correct &kde;,
it is important to ensure that the correct <command>startkde</command> script
is used as well.
</para>

<para>
Open the <filename>.xinitrc</filename> text file from the home directory, or
create it if necessary. Add the line:

<programlisting>
<command>exec</command> <option>${KDEDIR}/bin/startkde</option>
</programlisting>
</para>

<important><para>On some distributions, it may be necessary to perform the same
steps with the <filename>.xsession</filename> file, also in the home directory.
This is especially true when using graphical login managers such as
&kdm;, <application>gdm</application>, or <application>xdm</application>.</para>
</important>

<para>
Now start your fresh &kde;: in &BSD; and &Linux; systems with virtual terminal support,
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;&Alt;<keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo> ... <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;&Alt;<keycap>F12</keycap></keycombo> keystroke combinations are used to switch to Virtual Console 1 through 12.
This allows you to run more than one desktop environment at the same time. The fist six are
text terminals and the following six are graphical displays.
</para>

<para>
If when you start your computer you are presented to the graphical display
manager instead, you can use the new &kde; environment, even if it is not listed
as an option. Most display managers, including &kdm;, have an option to use
a <quote>Custom Session</quote> when you login. With this option, your session settings are
loaded from the <filename>.xsession</filename> file in your home directory. If
you have already modified this file as described above, this option should load
you into your new &kde; installation.
</para>

<para>If it does not, there is something else you can try that should normally
work: Press <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;&Alt;<keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo>,
and you will be presented to a text terminal. Log in using the dedicated user
and type:
</para>

<screen>
<command>startx</command> <option>--</option> <option>:1</option>
</screen>

<tip>
<para>
You can run the &kde; from sources and the old &kde; at the same time! Log in
using your regular user, start the stable &kde; desktop. Press <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;&Alt;<keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo> (or
<keycap>F1</keycap>, <keycap>F3</keycap>, etc..), and you will be presented
with a text terminal. Log in using the dedicated &kde; &subversion; user and
type:</para>

<screen>
<command>startx</command> <option>--</option> <option>:1</option>
</screen>

<para>You can go back to the &kde; desktop of your regular user by pressing the
shortcut key for the already running desktop. This is normally
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;&Alt;<keycap>F7</keycap></keycombo>, you may need
to use <keycap>F6</keycap> or <keycap>F8</keycap> instead. To return to your
&kdesvn-build;-compiled &kde;, you would use the same sequence, except with the
next function key. For example, if you needed to enter <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;&Alt;<keycap>F7</keycap></keycombo>
to switch to your regular &kde;, you would need to enter
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;&Alt;<keycap>F8</keycap></keycombo> to go back
to your &kdesvn-build; &kde;.</para>

<sect1 id="kdesvn-build-logging">
<title>&kdesvn-build;'s build logging</title>

<sect2 id="logging-overview">
<title>Logging overview</title>

<para>Logging is a &kdesvn-build; feature whereby the output from every command
that &kdesvn-build; runs is saved to a file for examination later, if
necessary. This is done because it is often necessary to have the output of
these programs when there is a build failure, because there are so many
reasons why a build can fail in the first place.</para>

<sect3 id="log-directory-layout">
<title>Logging directory layout</title>

<para>The logs are always stored under the log directory. The destination of
the log directory is controlled by the <link linkend="conf-log-dir">log-dir</link>
option, which defaults to <filename class="directory"><symbol>${source-dir}</symbol>/log</filename> (where
<symbol>${source-dir}</symbol> is the value of the <link linkend="conf-source-dir">source-dir</link>
option. The in rest of this section, this value will be referred to as
<symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>).</para>

<para>Under <symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>, is a set of directories, one for every
time that &kdesvn-build; was run. Each directory is named with the date, and
the run number. For instance, the second time that &kdesvn-build; is run on
May 26, 2004, it would create a directory called <filename>2004-05-26-02</filename>,
where the 2004-05-26 is for the date, and the -02 is the run number.</para>

<para>For your convenience, &kdesvn-build; will also create a link to the
logs for your latest run, called <filename class="directory">latest</filename>. So the logs for
the most recent &kdesvn-build; run should always be under <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest</filename>.
</para>

<para>Now, each directory for a &kdesvn-build; run will itself contain a set of
directories, one for every &kde; module that &kdesvn-build; tries to build. Also,
a file called <filename>build-status</filename> will be contained in the directory,
which will allow you to determine which modules built and which failed.</para>

<note><para>
If a module itself has a submodule (such as extragear/multimedia,
playground/utils, or KDE/kdelibs), then there would actually be a matching
layout in the log directory. For example, the logs for KDE/kdelibs after the
last &kdesvn-build; run would be found in <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/KDE/kdelibs</filename>,
and not under <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/kdelibs</filename>.
</para></note>

<para>In each module log directory, you will find a set of files for each
operation that &kdesvn-build; performs. If &kdesvn-build; updates a module,
you may see filenames such as <filename>svn-co.log</filename> (for a
module checkout) or <filename>svn-up.log</filename> (when updating a module
that has already been checked out). If the <command>configure</command>
command was run, then you would expect to see a <filename>configure.log</filename>
in that directory.</para>

<para>If an error occurred, you should be able to see an explanation of why in
one of the files. To help you determine which file contains the error,
&kdesvn-build; will create a link from the file containing the error (such as
<filename>build-1.log</filename> to a file called <filename>error.log</filename>).</para>

<para>The upshot to all of this is that to see why a module failed to build
after your last &kdesvn-build;, the file you should look at first is
<filename><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/<replaceable>module-name</replaceable>/error.log</filename>.
</para>

<tip><para>If the file <filename>error.log</filename> is empty (especially after
an installation), then perhaps there was no error. Some of the tools used by
the &kde; build system will sometimes mistakenly report an error when there was
none.</para>

<para>Also, some commands will evade &kdesvn-build;'s output redirection and
bypass the log file in certain circumstances (normally when performing the
first &subversion; checkout), and the error output in that case is not in the log file
but is instead at the &konsole; or terminal where you ran &kdesvn-build;.</para>

<row id="conf-async">

<entry>Cannot be overridden</entry>
<entry><para>This option enables the asynchronous mode of operation, where the source

<row id="conf-binpath">
<entry>binpath</entry>
<entry>Overrides global</entry>
<entry><para>Set this option to set the environment variable PATH while building.
You cannot override this setting in a module option. The default value is
the $<envar>PATH</envar> that is set when the script starts. This environment
variable should include the colon-separated paths of your development
toolchain. The paths <filename class="directory">$<envar>KDEDIR</envar>/bin</filename> and
<filename class="directory">$<envar>QTDIR</envar>/bin</filename> are automatically added. You

For instance, to checkout &kde; 4.4 branch, you would set this option to
<replaceable>4.4</replaceable>.</para>
<para>If &kdesvn-build; fails to properly download a branch with this option, you

<orderedlist>

<listitem><para>Relative to the &kde; &subversion; source directory (see <link
linkend="conf-source-dir">the source-dir option</link>). This is the default,
and is selected if you type a directory name that does not start with a tilde
(~) or a slash (/).</para> <para>The default value is <filename
class="directory">build</filename>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Absolute path. If you specify a path that begins with a /, then
that path is used directly. For example, <filename
class="directory">/tmp/kde-obj-dir/</filename>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Relative to your home directory. If you specify a path that
begins with a ~, then the path is used relative to your home directory,
analogous to the shell's tilde-expansion. For example, <filename
class="directory">~/builddir</filename> would set the build directory to
<filename
class="directory">/home/user-name/builddir</filename>.</para></listitem>

</orderedlist>

Perhaps surprisingly, this option can be changed per module.

</entry>
</row>

<row id="conf-checkout-only">
<entry>checkout-only</entry>
<entry>Overrides global</entry>
<entry><para>Set this option to checkout &subversion; sources piece by piece. The
value for this option should be a space-separated list of directories to
checkout.  Although this option overrides the global option, be aware that
setting this as a global option makes no sense.
</para>

<row id="conf-cmake-options">
<entry>cmake-options</entry>
<entry>Appends to global options (not applicable to qt-copy)</entry>
<entry><para>Use this option to specify what flags to pass to &cmake; when
creating the build system for the module. When this is used as a global option,
it is applied to all modules that this script builds. When used as a module
option, it is added to the end of the global options. This allows you to
specify common &cmake; options in the global section.</para>

<para>This option does not apply to qt-copy (which does not use &cmake;). Use
<link linkend="conf-configure-flags">configure-flags</link> instead.</para>

<para>Since these options are passed directly to the &cmake; command line, they
should be given as they would be typed into &cmake;. For example:</para>

<screen>  cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
</screen>

<para>Since this is a hassle, &kdesvn-build; takes pains to ensure that as long

<row id="conf-cxxflags">
<entry>cxxflags</entry>
<entry>Appends to global option</entry>

module. This option is
specified here instead of with <link
linkend="conf-configure-flags">configure-flags</link> or <link
linkend="conf-cmake-options">cmake-options</link> because this option will also
set the environment variable <envar>CXXFLAGS</envar> during the build process.</para>

<para>Note that for &kde; 4 and any other modules that use &cmake;, it is necessary to set the

<entry>Use this option to change the name a module is given on disk. For
example, if your module was extragear/network, you could rename it to
extragear-network using this option.  Note that although this changes the
name of the module on disk, it is not a good idea to include directories
or directory separators in the name as this will interfere with any

<title>Preface</title>

<para>Normally using &kdesvn-build; after you have gone through <xref linkend="getting-started" />
is as easy as doing the following from a terminal prompt:</para>

<screen>
<prompt>&percnt;</prompt> <command><userinput>kdesvn-build</userinput></command>
</screen>

<para>&kdesvn-build; will then download the sources for &kde;, try to configure

<sect2 id="using-qt-copy">
<title>qt-copy support</title>
<para>&kdesvn-build; supports building the &Qt; toolkit used by &kde; software
as a convenience to users. This support is handled by a special module named
qt-copy.</para>

<note><para>&Qt; is developed under a separate repository from &kde; software
located at <ulink
url="http://qt.gitorious.org/qt">http://qt.gitorious.org/qt</ulink>.</para></note>

<para>In order to build &Qt;, you should make sure that the
<link linkend="conf-qtdir">qtdir</link> setting is set to the directory you'd
like to install &Qt; to, as described in <xref linkend="configure-data"/>.</para>

<para>You should then ensure that the qt-copy module is added to
your <filename>.kdesvn-buildrc</filename>, before any other modules in the
file. If you are using the sample configuration file, you can simply
uncomment the existing qt-copy module entry.</para>

<para>Now you should verify the <link
linkend="conf-repository">repository</link> option and <link
linkend="conf-branch">branch</link> options are set appropriately:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The first option is to build with a grouping of recommended bug
fix and optimization patches applied (this used to be controlled using an
option called apply-patches). This collection is developed in a separate
repository at <ulink
url="http://gitorious.org/+kde-developers/qt/kde-qt">http://gitorious.org/+kde-developers/qt/kde-qt</ulink>.
If you would like to build with patches applied (most &kde; developers do) then
you should set your repository option to
<userinput>git://gitorious.org/+kde-developers/qt/kde-qt.git</userinput></para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>Otherwise, to build the standard &Qt;, set your repository
option to

</orderedlist>

<para>In both cases, the branch option should be set to <userinput>master</userinput> (unless you'd
like to build a different branch).</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="build-priority">
<title>Changing &kdesvn-build;'s build priority</title>
<para>Programs can run with different priority levels on Operating Systems,
including &Linux; and &BSD;. This allows the system to allocate time for the
different programs in accordance with how important they are.
</para>

<para>&kdesvn-build; will normally allocate itself a low priority so that the
rest of the programs on your system are unaffected and can run normally.
Using this technique, &kdesvn-build; will use extra CPU when it is available.
</para>

<para>&kdesvn-build; will still maintain a high enough priority level so that
it runs before routine batch processes and before CPU donation programs
such as <ulink url="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">Seti@Home</ulink>.
</para>

<para>To alter &kdesvn-build; so that it uses a higher (or lower) priority
level permanently, then you need to adjust the &niceness; setting in the <link
linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>. The &niceness; setting
controls how <quote>nice</quote> &kdesvn-build; is to other programs. In other
words, having a higher &niceness; gives &kdesvn-build; a lower priority. So to
give &kdesvn-build; a higher priority, reduce the &niceness; (and vice versa).
The &niceness; can go from 0 (not nice at all, highest priority) to 20 (super
nice, lowest priority).</para>

<para>You can also temporarily change the priority for &kdesvn-build; by using
the &cmd-nice; <link linkend="cmdline">command line option</link>. The value to
the option is used exactly the same as for &niceness;.</para>

<note><para>It is possible for some programs run by the super user to have a
negative nice value, with a correspondingly even higher priority for such
programs. Setting a negative (or even 0) &niceness; for &kdesvn-build; is not
a great idea, as it will not help run time significantly, but will make your
computer seem very sluggish should you still need to use it.
</para></note>

<informalexample>
<para>To run &kdesvn-build; with a niceness of 15 (a lower priority than
normal):</para>

<screen>
<prompt>&percnt;</prompt> <userinput><command>kdesvn-build</command> <option>--nice=<replaceable>15</replaceable></option></userinput>
</screen>

<para>Or, you can edit the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link> to make the change permanent:</para>

<screen>
    &niceness; <replaceable>15</replaceable>
</screen>
</informalexample>

<tip>
<para>The <link linkend="conf-niceness">niceness</link> option only affects the
usage of the computer's processor(s). One other major affect on computer
performance relates to how much data input or output (<acronym>I/O</acronym>) a
program uses. In order to control how much <acronym>I/O</acronym> a program can
use, modern &Linux; operating systems support a similar tool called
<application>ionice</application>. &kdesvn-build; supports
<application>ionice</application>, (but only to enable or disable it
completely) using the <link
linkend="conf-use-idle-io-priority">use-idle-io-priority</link> option,
since &kdesvn-build; version 1.12.
</para>
</tip>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="root-installation">
<title>Installation as the superuser</title>
<para>You may wish to have &kdesvn-build; run the installation with super user
privileges. This may be for the unrecommended system-wide installation.
This is also useful when using a recommended single user &kde; build, however.
This is because some modules (especially kdebase) install programs that will
briefly need elevated permissions when run. They are not able to achieve these
permission levels unless they are installed with the elevated permissions.
</para>

<para>You could simply run &kdesvn-build; as the super user directly, but this
is not recommended, since the program has not been audited for that kind of use.
Although it should be safe to run the program in this fashion, it is better to
avoid running as the super user when possible.</para>

<para>To take care of this, &kdesvn-build; provides the &make-install-prefix;
option. You can use this option to specify a command to use to perform the
installation as another user. The recommended way to use this command is with
the &sudo; program, which will run the install command as the super user.
</para>

<informalexample>
<para>For example, to install all modules using &sudo;,
you could do something like this:</para>

<screen>
global
  &make-install-prefix; <replaceable>sudo</replaceable>
  # Other options
end global
</screen>

<para>To use &make-install-prefix; for only a single module, this would work:
</para>

<screen>
module <replaceable>kdemultimedia</replaceable>
  &make-install-prefix; <replaceable>sudo</replaceable>
end module
</screen>

<sect2 id="build-progress">
<title>Showing the progress of a module build</title>
<para>This feature is always available, and is automatically enabled when

build a module.

<sect2 id="partial-builds">
<title>Partially building a module</title>
<para>It is possible to build only pieces from a single &kde; module. For
example, you may want to compile only one program from a module. &kdesvn-build;
has features to make this easy. There are several complementing ways to
do this.
</para>

<sect3 id="checking-out-parts">
<title>Checking out portions of a module</title>

<para>This is perhaps the best way to do this. When it works, it will save you
download time and disk space. What happens is that &kdesvn-build; will download
only the parts of a module that you specify. This is done using the &checkout-only;
option for a module, which will specify a list of directories to download.
</para>

<tip><para>
If you do not already know what to download from a module, it may be a good idea
to browse the &subversion; layout for a module first, using
<ulink url="http://websvn.kde.org/branches/KDE/3.5/">WebSVN</ulink>.
</para></tip>

<informalexample>
<para>To only grab &kuser; and &kdat; from kdeadmin, you could use &checkout-only;
like this:</para>

<screen>
module <replaceable>kdeadmin</replaceable>
  &checkout-only; <replaceable>kuser kdat</replaceable>
end module
</screen>

</informalexample>

<important><para>The directories will be built in the order they are listed
in the option. If one of the directories needs something else from the module
to compile, then you need to make sure they are both in the &checkout-only;
line, and that the required dependency goes before the directory that needs it.</para>

<para>Also, sometimes an application may need other directories and it is hard
to figure out what they are, which may require some trial and error of constantly
adding directories to the option to figure out.</para>
</important>

<para>One final note to make about this option: If you change the value of this
option, you should use <userinput><command>kdesvn-build</command>
<option>&cmd-refresh-build;</option> <option><replaceable>module</replaceable></option></userinput>
in order to ensure that the module is reconfigured properly. In addition,
&kdesvn-build; will never remove existing files if you take away the number of
directories from your &checkout-only; option, or add the option to a module that
has already been checked out.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="not-compiling">
<title>Removing directories from a build</title>
<para>Instead of restricting what is downloaded, it is possible to download
everything but have the build system leave out a few directories when it does
the build. This may be useful if one directory always breaks and is
unnecessary to the rest of the module.
</para>

<para>This is controlled with the &do-not-compile; option. It works similar
to the &checkout-only; option just described, in that it is simply a list of
directories that should not be compiled.</para>

<important><para>
Also like &checkout-only;, this option requires at least that the
<command>configure</command> script is run again for the module after changing
it. This is done using the <userinput><command>kdesvn-build</command>
<option>&cmd-reconfigure;</option>
<option><replaceable>module</replaceable></option></userinput> command.
</para></important>

<informalexample>
<para>To remove the <filename>dcoppython</filename> directory from the kdebindings build process:</para>

<sect2 id="using-branches">
<title>Branching and tagging support for &kdesvn-build;</title>

<sect3 id="branches-and-tags">
<title>What are branches and tags?</title>

<para>&subversion; supports managing the history of the &kde; source code. &kde;
uses this support to create branches for development, and to tag the repository
every so often with a new version release.
</para>

<para>For example, the &kmail; developers may be working on a new feature in
a different branch in order to avoid breaking the version being used by most
developers. This branch has development ongoing inside it, even while the
main branch (called /trunk) may have development going on inside of it.
</para>

<para>A tag, on the other hand, is a snapshot of the source code repository
at a position in time. This is used by the &kde; administration team to mark
off a version of code suitable for release and still allow the developers to
work on the code.
</para>

<para>In &subversion;, there is no difference between branches, tags, or trunk within
the code. It is only a convention used by the developers. This makes it
difficult to properly support branches and tags within &kdesvn-build;. However,
there are some things that can be done.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="branch-support">
<title>How to use branches and tags</title>

<para>Support for branches and tags is handled by a set of options, which
range from a generic request for a version, to a specific &url; to download
for advanced users.
</para>

<para>The easiest method is to use the &branch; and &tag; options. You simply
use the option along with the name of the desired branch or tag for a module,
and &kdesvn-build; will try to determine the appropriate location within the
&kde; repository to download from. For most &kde; modules this works very
well.</para>

<informalexample>
<para>To download kdelibs from &kde; 3.5 (which is simply known as the 3.5 branch):
</para>

<screen>
module kdelibs
  branch <replaceable>3.5</replaceable>
  # other options...
end module
</screen>

<para>Or, to download kdemultimedia as it was released with &kde; 3.4.3:</para>

<screen>
module kdemultimedia
  tag <replaceable>3.4.3</replaceable>
  # other options...
end module
</screen>

</informalexample>

<tip><para>You can specify a global branch value. But if you do so, do not forget
to specify a different branch for modules that should not use the global branch!
</para></tip>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="advanced-branches">
<title>Advanced branch support options</title>

<para>&kdesvn-build; supports two options for situations where &branch; and &tag;
guess the correct path improperly: &module-base-path; and &override-url;.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
&module-base-path; is used to help &kdesvn-build; fill in the missing part of
a module's path. In the &kde; repository, all of the paths are of the form
<filename class="directory">svnRoot/module-base-path/<replaceable>module-name</replaceable></filename>. Normally &kdesvn-build;
can figure out the appropriate middle part by itself. When it cannot, you can use
&module-base-path;, like this:
</para>

<informalexample>
<screen>
module qt-copy
  # branch does not work here yet
  module-base-path branches/qt/3.3

<para>This would cause &kdesvn-build; to download qt-copy from (in this example),
<filename>svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/<replaceable>branches/qt/3.3</replaceable>/qt-copy</filename>.
</para>
</informalexample>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>The &override-url; option, on the other hand, requires you to
specify the exact path to download from. However, this allows you to pull from
paths that &kdesvn-build; would have no hope of downloading from.
</para>

<informalexample>
<screen>
module qt-copy
  # Specify exact path to grab.

<para>&kdesvn-build; used to include features to automatically attempt to
rebuild the module after a failure (as sometimes this re-attempt would work,
due to bugs in the build system at that time). Thanks to switching to &cmake;
the build system no longer suffers from these bugs, and so &kdesvn-build; will
not try to build a module more than once. There are situations where
&kdesvn-build; will automatically take action though:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>If you change <link linkend="conf-configure-flags">configure-flags</link>

<title>Manually rebuilding a module</title>
<para>If you make a change to a module's option settings, or the module's

manually rebuild the module.</para>

<para>You can do this by simply running <userinput><command>kdesvn-build</command>
 <option>--refresh-build</option> <option><replaceable>module</replaceable></option></userinput>.
</para>

<para>If you would like to have &kdesvn-build; automatically rebuild the module
during the next normal build update instead, you can create a special file.
Every module has a build directory. If you create a file called <filename>.refresh-me</filename>
in the build directory for a module, &kdesvn-build; will rebuild the module
next time the build process occurs, even if it would normally perform the
faster incremental build.</para>

<tip>
<para>By default, the build directory is <filename class="directory">~/kdesvn/build/<replaceable>module</replaceable>/</filename>.
If you change the setting of the &build-dir; option, then use that instead of

<para>However, you may want to change the setting for environment variables
that &kdesvn-build; does not provide an option for directly. (For instance,

<sect2 id="email-reports">
<title>E-mailing build failure reports</title>
<para>&kdesvn-build; can send a e-mail report to an e-mail address of your
choice when a module fails to build for whatever reason. The way it works
is that you choose an e-mail address that &kdesvn-build; will send from,
and an e-mail address to notify when there is an error.</para>

<para>&kdesvn-build; will then, at the end of a complete run, construct an
e-mail if there were any modules that failed to build. The e-mail will contain
an abbreviated failure log for each module. Only one e-mail is sent for a
run, even if 15 modules failed to build.
</para>

<para>This feature is not enabled by default. To enable it, you need to set
both the &email-address; and &email-on-compile-error; options. <option>email-address</option>
controls the address &kdesvn-build; sends from, and <option>email-on-compile-error</option>
controls where to send the e-mail message to.
</para>

<tip>
<para>&kdesvn-build; uses the Perl-standard Mail::Mailer module to send e-mail.
It is included with Perl 5.8, and is installable with Perl 5.6. Mail::Mailer
supports <application>Sendmail</application> (including <application>Sendmail</application>-compatible
e-mail clients), native <acronym>SMTP</acronym> transport, and <application>qmail</application>.
</para>

  email-address          foo@example.com    # From: address for any kdesvn-build e-mail
  email-on-compile-error bar@example.com    # To: address for build failure e-mail

<sect2 id="deleting-build-dir">
<title>Removing unneeded directories after a build</title>
<para>Are you short on disk space but still want to run a bleeding-edge
&kde; checkout?  &kdesvn-build; can help reduce your disk usage when building
&kde; from &subversion;.</para>

<note><para>Be aware that building &kde; does take a lot of space. There are
several major space-using pieces when using &kdesvn-build;:</para></note>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The actual source checkout can take up a fair amount of space.
The default modules take up about 1.6 gigabytes of on-disk space. You can reduce
this amount by making sure that you are only building as many modules as you
actually want. &kdesvn-build; will not delete source code from disk even if you
delete the entry from the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>, so make sure that you go and delete unused
source checkouts from the source directory. Note that the source files are
downloaded from the Internet, you <emphasis>should not</emphasis> delete them
if you are actually using them, at least until you are done using
&kdesvn-build;.</para>

<para>Also, if you already have a &Qt; installed by your distribution (and
the odds are good that you do), you probably do not need to install the
qt-copy module. That will shave about 200 megabytes off of the on-disk source
size.</para>

<para>One thing to note is that due to the way &subversion; works: there are actually
two files on disk for every file checked-out from the repository. &kdesvn-build;
does not have code at this point to try and minimize the source size when the
source is not being used.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>&kdesvn-build; will create a separate build directory to build the source
code in. Sometimes &kdesvn-build; will have to copy a source directory to
create a fake build directory. When this happens, space-saving symlinks are
used, so this should not be a hassle on disk space. The build directory will
typically be much larger than the source directory for a module. For example,
the build directory for kdebase is about 1050 megabytes, whereas kdebase's
source is only around 550 megabytes.</para>

<para>Luckily, the build directory is not required after a module has
successfully been built and installed. &kdesvn-build; can automatically
remove the build directory after installing a module, see the examples below
for more information. Note that taking this step will make it impossible
for &kdesvn-build; to perform the time-saving incremental builds.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>
Finally, there is disk space required for the actual installation of
&kde;, which does not run from the build directory. This typically takes less
space than the build directory. It is harder to get exact figures however.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>How do you reduce the space requirements of &kde;?  One way is to
use the proper compiler flags, to optimize for space reduction instead of
for speed. Another way, which can have a large effect, is to remove debugging
information from your &kde; build.
</para>

<warning><para>
You should be very sure you know what you are doing before deciding to remove
debugging information. Running bleeding-edge software means you are running
software which is potentially much more likely to crash than a stable release.
If you are running software without debugging information, it can be very
hard to create a good bug report to get your bug resolved, and you will likely
have to re-enable debugging information for the affected application and
rebuild to help a developer fix the crash. So, remove debugging information
at your own risk!
</para></warning>

directory is still kept, and debugging is enabled:</para>

<title>Introduction to &cmake;</title>

<para>In March 2006, the &cmake; program
beat out several competitors and was selected to be the build system for &kde; 4, replacing the
autotools-based system that &kde; has used from the beginning.</para>

<para>A introduction to &cmake; page is available on the <ulink
url="http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/CMake">&kde; TechBase</ulink>.
Basically, instead of running <userinput><command>make</command> <option>-f</option>
<filename>Makefile.cvs</filename></userinput>, then <command>configure</command>,
then &make;, we simply run &cmake; and then &make;.
</para>

<para>&kdesvn-build; has support for &cmake;. A few features of &kdesvn-build;
were really features of the underlying buildsystem, including
<link linkend="conf-configure-flags">configure-flags</link>
and <link linkend="conf-do-not-compile">do-not-compile</link>. When equivalent
features are available, they are provided. For instance, the equivalent to the
configure-flags option is <link linkend="conf-cmake-options">cmake-options</link>, and the
<link linkend="conf-do-not-compile">do-not-compile</link> option is also supported for &cmake;
as of &kdesvn-build; version 1.6.3.
