# Where are your KDE sources?

KDESRCDIR="/home/dirk/src/kde"

# Where shall I put the binaries?

QTDIR="/usr/X11/lib/qt"

# If you would like logfiles of the compilation process, specify a directory
# here in which the logfiles will be saved. If you want to disable logfile
# generation, leave this blank.
#
KDELOGDIR="$KDESRCDIR/log"

# Do you want the logfiles to be compressed? Set this variable to "yes" to
# make the script compress the logfiles using bzip2 (using gzip as a
# fallback is bzip2 cannot be found) and thereby save some diskspace.
#
COMPRESSLOGS="yes"

# Add modules you want to get compiled to this space-seperated list. Note that
# you don't have to mention the fundamental modules 'arts, 'kdesupport',
# 'kdelibs' and 'kdebase' here since the kde-build script will care about them
# automatically.
#
KDEMODULES="kdenetwork kdegames kdeutils"

# Do you want a clean install? This is recommended but please note that
# you cannot use your previous KDE2 desktop while the compilation is
# running. Set this to "no" to install the new snapshot over the previous
# one, otherwise set it to "yes".
#
INSTALLFROMSCRATCH="no"

# Do you plan to use this box otherwise while compiling? If so, you'd
# probably set this variable to "yes". If this is set to "no", the
# compilation process will try to eat up all the ressources, which speeds up
# the overall progress but makes it a PITA to work on this box. ;)
#
COMPILENICE="yes"

# Set this variable to "yes" to activate certain cheap tweaks to speed up the
# compilation process. Those tweaks mainly consist of lowering the
# optimization of the resulting binary code.
#
TWEAKCOMPILE="no"

# Which command is used to update your sources?
# anoncvs and cvs users: set this to "cvs"
# cvsup users: set this to "cvsup"
#
CVSCLIENT="cvs"

# For CVS users only: Do you have a CVS account? If so, set this variable to
# the correct name, otherwise leave this blank to use anonymous CVS.
#
ACCOUNT="mueller"

# Do you want any special branch? If so, specify its tag here e.g.
# KDE_2_2_BRANCH  or KDE_3_0_ALPHA_1. If you want the
# plain HEAD branch, leave this empty.
#
BRANCH=""

# For cvsup users only: specify your preferred cvsup mirror here, check
# http://www.kde.org/cvsupmirrors.html for a list of cvsup mirrors.
#
CVSUPSERVER="cvsup.kde.org"

# If there are any modules in $KDESRCDIR which you don't want to be updated,
# you can specify them in this space-seperated list, e.g. "qt-copy kde-common".
#
EXCLUDE="qt-copy kdenonbeta kde-i18n www qt kdeutils kde-common bugs"

# If you would like a virgin cvs copy set this field to "yes", otherwise set
# this to "no" (if set to "yes", 'make -f admin/Makefile.common cvs-clean'
# is executed for every module).
# Developers might find this pretty dangerous considering that they could have
# forgotten to 'cvs add' a file... ;-)
# Users who want to stay at the bleeding edge will want to activate this in
# order to make sure there aren't any remains of a previous compile.
